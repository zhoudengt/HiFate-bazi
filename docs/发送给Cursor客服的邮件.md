Subject: Cannot Use Claude Model Despite Pro+ Subscription - Region Restriction Issue

Dear Cursor Support Team,

I am a Cursor Pro+ subscriber ($60/month) and I am unable to use the Claude model due to region restrictions.

Issue:
- I have an active Pro+ subscription ($60/month)
- When trying to use Claude, I receive the error: "This model provider doesn't serve your region"
- My billing account is registered in China

I have already tried:
- Using VPN/proxy (Clash Verge with US nodes)
- Configuring system proxy settings
- But the issue persists, suggesting it may be account-level restriction

Request:
I would like to request assistance to:
1. Update my account region/billing address to a supported region (e.g., United States), OR
2. Resolve this region restriction issue so I can use my Pro+ subscription normally

My account information:
- Email: [您的邮箱地址]
- Subscription: Pro+ ($60/month)
- Current billing address: China

I have already paid for the Pro+ subscription and would like to be able to use the service I paid for. Please help me resolve this issue.

Thank you for your assistance!

Best regards,
[您的名字]

Subject: Request for Assistance - Pro+ Subscriber Unable to Use Claude Model Due to Region Restriction

Dear Cursor Support Team,

I am writing to request assistance with a region restriction issue that is preventing me from using the Claude model despite having an active Cursor Pro+ subscription.

Problem Description:
I have successfully subscribed to Cursor Pro+ ($60/month) and the payment has been processed. However, when I attempt to use the Claude model, I encounter the following error message:
"This model provider doesn't serve your region. Visit https://docs.cursor.com/account/regions for more information."

Account Details:
- Email: [您的邮箱地址]
- Subscription Plan: Cursor Pro+ ($60/month)
- Subscription Status: Active
- Billing Address: China

Troubleshooting Attempted:
I have already tried the following solutions:
1. Configured system-wide proxy (Clash Verge) with US nodes
2. Set up HTTP proxy in Cursor settings (127.0.0.1:7897)
3. Enabled proxy support in Cursor configuration
4. Verified that the proxy is working correctly for other services

However, the region restriction error persists, which suggests that the restriction may be based on account-level information (such as billing address or registration country) rather than IP address alone.

Request:
I would like to request your assistance to resolve this issue. Possible solutions could include:
1. Updating my account region/billing address to a supported region (e.g., United States)
2. Manually overriding the region restriction for my account
3. Providing guidance on how to properly configure my account to use the Pro+ subscription

I have already paid for the Pro+ subscription and would appreciate your help in enabling me to use the service I have subscribed to. I am willing to provide any additional information or documentation needed to resolve this issue.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
[您的名字]
